## 1. UML Diagram

```
           +------------------+
           |   Employee       |
           |------------------|
                   /   \
                  /     \
     +----------------+   +----------------+
     |   Engineer      |   |   Manager      |
     |-----------------|   |----------------|
     
```

## 2. Can an Engineer Also Become a Manager?

No, it is not possible in this design for an engineer to also become a manager because:

- The `Engineer` and `Manager` classes are concrete subclasses of `Employee`.
- Java does not allow multiple inheritance for classes, meaning an object cannot simultaneously belong to both subclasses.
